# About

I believe CSS and JS can live in harmony. This is an experimental codebase to try out techniques new and old. Built to use locally in a monorepo, but available from public npm registry. 

## Install

### As a normal npm module:

```yarn add @techytools/ui```

### In a monorepo:

```
  cd path-to-your-monorepo/workspace
  git clone git@github.com:techytools/ui.git ui
  rm -rf ui/.git
  git add ui
  git commit -m "added @techytools/ui library to monorepo"
  git push
```
