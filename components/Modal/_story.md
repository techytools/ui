Vertically centered. No padding. No X button. For showing any type of content.

An extension of the content where it was triggered from. Works with the focus of the rest of the elements. Modal takes over focus when opened. When closed, it gives back focus to the element that triggered

<!-- If showing very little content, then the modal can function as a dialog prompt. If showing a lot of content, modal will be full-height and content will scroll inside it.
